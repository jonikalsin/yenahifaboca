But it’s their ability to mimic speech that attracts many people to them over more traditional pets like dogs and cats. Some birds have incredible vocabularies of hundreds of words—notably, parrots like the African Grey—while other talking parrots have lesser vocabularies but are easier to care for overall.</p><p>There are dozens of bird species that are capable of mimicking speech, although some have incredible capabilities of learning words that others just don’t possess. That said, training, diet, and care are all part of keeping your bird healthy and thus, increasing their capability of speech. These factors are arguably more important than simply choosing a talkative species. Still, some have an innate talent for the art of mimicking, and here are 10 of our favorites!</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64></p><h2><span id=The_10_Best_Talking_Pet_Bird_Species>The 10 Best Talking Pet Bird Species</span></h2><h3 class=num-head><span id=1_African_Grey><span class=dhn>1.</span> African Grey</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64><table width=623><tbody readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Psittacus erithacus (Congo African Grey), P. erithacus subspecies timneh (Timneh African Grey)</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>10–13 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>50–200 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>40–50 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>African Grey</a> is one of the most well-known talking birds and for good reason. Researchers have proven that these birds have one of the largest capabilities for learning to mimic speech. Some are known to have memorized 1,000 words and more with the right training. These birds are highly intelligent and need a ton of mental stimulation, so they are quite a challenge to look after.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=2_Amazon_Parrot><span class=dhn>2.</span> Amazon Parrot</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><table width=623><tbody readability=4><tr readability=8><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Amazona auropalliata (Yellow-naped), Amazona ocrocephala (Yellow Crowned Amazon), Amazona oratrix (Double Yellow Headed), Amazona aestiva (Blue Fronted Amazons), Amazona amazonica (Orange-winged Amazon)</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>13–15 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>100–150 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>50–70 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Amazon parrots</a> are also known for their exceptional speaking abilities and have the ability to speak more clearly and string more words together in phrases than African Greys, notably the Yellow-Naped variety. These talking parrots are large, hardy, and active, and in addition to their speaking, they have a loud, piercing squawk too. They are also highly adept at learning tricks and even singing. However, many owners claim that they become highly attached to their keepers and may act aggressively toward strangers.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=3_Quaker_Parakeet><span class=dhn>3.</span> Quaker Parakeet</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><table width=623><tbody><tr><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Myopsitta monachus</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>8–11 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>40–100 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>20–30 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Also commonly known as the <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Monk Parakeet</a>, the Quaker Parakeet is a small, intelligent, and active bird that is known to talk incessantly when they’re in the mood and mimic various other sounds from their environment. They are often described as having the personality of a Cockatoo in the body of a Parakeet because they are so entertaining and interactive and don’t have the high care needs of larger birds.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=4_Ring-Necked_Parakeet><span class=dhn>4.</span> Ring-Necked Parakeet</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><table width=623><tbody><tr><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Psittacula krameri</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>10–16 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>200–250 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>20–30 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Ring-Necked Parakeet hails from India and Asia and was kept as a pet by royalty because their talking skills were so highly revered. While they are intelligent animals known for having vocabularies amounting to hundreds of words, they are far more docile and quieter than other taking parrots and need a fair bit of training and interaction with their owners.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=5_Eclectus_Parrot><span class=dhn>5.</span> Eclectus Parrot</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><table width=623><tbody><tr><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Eclectus roratus</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>12–14 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>100–150 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>20–30 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Native to New Guinea, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Eclectus Parrots</a> are known for the clarity of their speech and can commonly be heard singing too—often entire songs! These talking parrots are different from many other species in that they are dimorphic, meaning that males are starkly different in appearance from females. Males are generally also more docile than females, although both have the same gift for mimicking speech and sounds.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=6_Budgerigars><span class=dhn>6.</span> Budgerigars</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><table width=623><tbody><tr><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Melopsittacus undulatus</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>5–7 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>100–500 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>8–10 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite their tiny size, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Budgies</a> have a massive vocabulary. In fact, a Budgie named Puck has the Guinness World Record for the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link=external>largest vocabulary</a> of any bird and knew an incredible 1,728 separate words before their death. These small, interactive, and intelligent birds are popular pets for various reasons, not least their capability for learning an incredible amount of words.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=7_Macaws><span class=dhn>7.</span> Macaws</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><table width=623><tbody><tr><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Ara macao</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>10–40 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>50–100 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>40–50 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Macaws are the largest species of parrot, with Hyacinth Macaws often reaching 40 inches in length. They have fairly extensive vocabularies but can be difficult to train. These birds are intelligent, energetic, and loud, making them a challenge for novice owners. While their speech is not as clear as some other talking parrots, they make up for it by being excessively loud. They have the unique skill of mimicking other sounds and <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>singing songs</a> too.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=8_Cockatoo><span class=dhn>8.</span> Cockatoo</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><table width=623><tbody readability=2.5><tr readability=5><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Eolophus roseicapilla (Rose-breasted or Galah), Cacatau sulphurea (Yellow-crested), Cacatau tenuirostris (Long-billed corella)</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>10–18 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>10–50 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>30–50 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Cockatoos</a> are intelligent and extremely social birds that can have a fairly wide vocabulary with the right training. Some individuals may never learn to talk, while others will mimic a wide variety of sounds. It depends on their environment and training. Also, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>some species</a>, such as the Yellow-Crested, are more adept at learning speech. While they do not have as wide a vocabulary as many other talking parrot species, Cockatoos are certainly not quiet. These birds are known for being one of the loudest parrot species.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=9_Derbyan_Parakeet><span class=dhn>9.</span> Derbyan Parakeet</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><table width=623><tbody><tr><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Psittacula derbiana</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>10–20 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>20–50 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>20–30 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Derbyan Parakeet is one of the largest parakeet species and is sexually dimorphic. They are lively and active birds that can be a challenge to train. While they are known to be noisy, they can learn several dozen words with training too. Although they don’t have as large a vocabulary as some other parrot species, their clarity of speech is what sets them apart from the rest. They are rare birds, and their numbers are dwindling in the wild due to illegal poaching.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=10_Hill_Myna><span class=dhn>10.</span> Hill Myna</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><table width=623><tbody><tr><td width=90><strong>Species:</strong></td><td width=450>Gracula religiosa</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Size:</strong></td><td width=450>10–12 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></td><td width=450>50–100 words</td></tr><tr><td width=90><strong>Lifespan:</strong></td><td width=450>15–20 years</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Hill Myna is not a parrot but has an extensive vocabulary that compares to many parrot species. They have a wide range of vocalizations that can include whistling, screeching, and speech that is close to a human’s; they can mimic human speech in almost the exact tone and timbre, which is almost unsettling in its accuracy. They are native to Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia and adapt easily to new environments. Their popularity as pets is rapidly growing.</p><p class="text-light-gray text-small">Featured Image Credit: Nel Botha, Pixabay</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolam4prHNZ5qopV%2BXsrTAjK2YpaOZo7RuvMStZJuhopl6tLzEnKCeq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stana-katic.html><span>←</span><span>Stana Katic</span></a>
