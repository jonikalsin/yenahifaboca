The legality of this sport has been a topic of interest due to its apparent brutality and safety concerns. The Power Slap League, backed by the UFC and governed by the Nevada Athletic Commission, has established specific rules and safety measures to address these concerns and ensure the legality of the sport.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Nevada Athletic Commission has approved amended rules for the UFC-backed Power Slap competition, which involves slap fighting. Competitors are only allowed to deliver open-handed blows above the chin, with disqualification for any violations. This rule is essential in maintaining the safety of the competitors and preventing potential serious injuries.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Furthermore, the league has taken significant steps to address safety concerns by implementing video review for every strike. This allows for a thorough assessment of each blow delivered during the competition, ensuring that the rules are adhered to and any potential fouls are promptly addressed. These measures demonstrate the league's commitment to prioritizing the safety of its competitors.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The involvement of UFC President Dana White in the Power Slap League has also brought attention to the sport. While the UFC does not operate the league, White's association with it highlights the significant support and attention the sport has garnered within the combat sports industry. The approval of upcoming Power Slap events in Las Vegas further underscores the legal recognition and acceptance of the sport by relevant authorities.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite the safety measures and regulatory approval, criticism has been directed towards slap fighting for its perceived brutality and safety risks. However, proponents of the sport, including UFC President Dana White, have defended it, drawing parallels to the initial opposition faced by mixed martial arts (MMA). The comparison suggests that like MMA, slap fighting may undergo a similar process of acceptance and recognition as a legitimate sport.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The origins of slap fighting can be traced back to viral videos from Eastern Europe and have since gained attention and investment from notable figures such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Logan Paul. This indicates the growing popularity and interest in this unique form of competition. The UFC's involvement and dominance in slap fighting can be attributed to its close ties to the Nevada State Athletic Commission. The influence of key individuals within the commission and the combat sports industry has played a significant role in the sport's success and legal recognition.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to safety regulations, the financial aspects of slap fighting have also been a point of discussion. Slap fighters have been reported to receive minimal pay, and they are contractually prohibited from displaying their own sponsors, instead being required to wear promotional attire. These factors raise questions about the overall treatment and compensation of competitors within the sport.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The legal standing of Power Slap is further reinforced by the regulatory approval and oversight provided by the Nevada Athletic Commission, which has established specific rules and safety measures to govern the sport. The involvement of prominent figures such as Dana White and the support from investors and celebrities also contribute to the sport's legitimacy and recognition within the combat sports industry.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>As slap fighting continues to attract attention and evolve as a competitive sport, its legal status and regulatory framework will remain essential aspects of its development. The implementation of stringent safety measures, adherence to rules, and ongoing oversight by relevant authorities will be crucial in shaping the future of Power Slap as a recognized and respected sport within the realm of combat sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBlmah6sbvWnqlmq5yWvW64xKCYpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-do-247sports-rankings-work.html><span>←</span><span>How do 247Sports rankings work?</span></a>
