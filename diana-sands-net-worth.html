She also appeared in a number of dramatic television series in the sixties and seventies such as I Spy, as Davala Unawa in the 1967 The Fugitive episode "Dossier on a Diplomat", Dr. Harrison in the Outer Limits episode "The Mice", and Julia. Sands also starred in the 1963 film An Affair of the Skin as the narrator and photographer, Janice.A member of the Actors Studio, Sands' performance in the Studio's 1964 production of James Baldwin's Blues for Mr. Charlie was a highlight of that show, and one which would be sorely missed during its subsequent London engagement when Sands had already committed to co-starring with Alan Alda in the original Broadway production of The Owl and the Pussycat (1964) for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Sands was culled eight years later to provide a track for the Original New York Cast album of Free to Be... You and Me. Unfortunately, she had died by the time the ABC Afterschool Special had begun production and her previously recorded vocal track was not selected for inclusion.In 1970, Diana Sands co-starred in the Norman Jewison produced film, The Landlord, directed by Hal Ashby and starring Beau Bridges, Lee Grant, Susan Anspach, Robert Klein, Trish Van Devere, Hector Elizondo, Lou Gossett Jr., and Pearl Bailey.In his memoirs, Bob Dylan tells of meeting Ms. Sands at a party and states that she was, "an electrifying actress who I might have been secretly in love with..."She was set to star in the film Claudine (1974) with James Earl Jones, however, she was too ill to accept the role and it went to her friend Diahann Carroll. She was twice nominated for a Tony Award, and twice nominated for an Emmy Award as well.She died of leiomyosarcoma at aged 39. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=4><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 22, 1934</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>1973-09-21</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Lucien Happersberger</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Diana Sands, Sands, Diana</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Leo</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>I refuse to be stereotyped.
