Joy mocked Meghan for the reaction, which led Meghan to explain why she was so mortified. “It’s just, we had a conversation with standards before that we weren’t supposed to say that,” Meghan explained. “That’s why I said ‘Oh my God.’ Sorry. His pants look weird, but we weren’t supposed to say that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/donald-trump-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Joy claimed that she was not privy to this discussion. “I did not have that conversation with standards,” she insisted. “I don’t know…the guy stole so much money from his constituents and he continues to say that he won the election. He has nobody he can go to for better pants? And where’s&nbsp;<strong>Melania [Trump]</strong>? She’s not ironing them anymore?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Trump caused quite a frenzy on Twitter when he showed up to the North Carolina event with his unkempt pants on June 5. Most people were convinced that Trump was wearing the pants backwards, since there was no fly visible in the front. Trump did not respond to the speculation, but the buzz has clearly still continued into the new week!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49wZqOnqWKvprTAq2Sdp56WuaV506uspqhdrL%2BqusqlnJ1loJa7tb%2BMrZ%2BeZaaesrh5zJ6eoZmeYrqkr8CipWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eric-adams-defends-firing-of-top-internal-jails-cop-after-union-pressure.html><span>←</span><span>Eric Adams defends firing of top internal jails cop after union pressure</span></a>
