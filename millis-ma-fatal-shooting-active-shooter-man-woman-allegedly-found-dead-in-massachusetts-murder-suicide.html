Both victims had been shot, and a gun had been discovered beside their car at the site. The public was not thought to be in danger, according to the authorities.</p><p>The victims, who were both Millis residents and in their 20s, knew one another, according to the Norfolk District Attorney’s Office and Millis police. Investigators were in the process of getting in touch with the families of the man and lady, who had moved to Millis from out of state, even though their identities remained undisclosed.</p><p>The remains were found close to the intersection of Route 27 and Route 115, along a lonely dirt road. About nine in the morning, a town employee made the somber finding, though it was still unclear when the gunshot occurred.</p><p>It has been confirmed by law enforcement authorities that the gun was discovered under the man’s body. They did not, however, confirm if the fatalities were caused by a murder-suicide. Although there is still much to be done in this investigation, according to District Attorney Michael Morrissey, they do not currently have any proof of third parties’ involvement.</p><p>Within the next 24 to 48 hours, the Medical Examiner could be able to provide details regarding the cause and manner of death. According to authorities, state ballistics and chemistry professionals were assisting state and local police with their investigation.</p><p>Although officers were expected to be at the scene for several hours, Millis officers Chief Christopher Soffayer emphasized that there appeared to be no evident danger to the town’s citizens. “While residents will be upset by such an incident, there appears to be no ongoing threat or danger to Millis residents associated with this incident,” he stated in a statement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismKm%2ForrQrqacrJ%2BWu62twp2sqKaXY7KlwY2vpWilmaG5qr%2BMpphmnpGprq150qGmqKyZo7RurcKtoK%2BdXai1sLvTnqlmpZGjeri7zJqlZpmcobKoscOlsGaen6q7pXnDnpidZZmjeq6t0qyYnKClqLK1wNJmpK6qlJq%2Fbr%2FUopqinJVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-the-fokkens.html><span>←</span><span>Meet The Fokkens</span></a>
