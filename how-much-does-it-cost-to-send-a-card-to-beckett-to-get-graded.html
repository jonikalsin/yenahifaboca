Beckett Grading Services (BGS) is one such renowned service that collectors often turn to. But what does it cost to send a card to Beckett for grading? In this article, we will explore the cost structure and steps involved in sending your cards to Beckett for grading.</p><h2>Understanding Beckett Grading Services</h2><p>Beckett Grading Services is a trusted and widely recognized company that provides professional card grading services to collectors and enthusiasts. With their expertise and strict grading standards, Beckett assigns a grade to each card, indicating its condition and overall quality. This grading process helps collectors and sellers determine the value of their cards in the market.</p><h2>Cost of Sending Cards to Beckett</h2><p>The cost of sending a card to Beckett for grading depends on several factors, including the type and value of the card, the desired turnaround time, and any additional services requested. Beckett offers different levels of services, each with its own pricing structure. Let's take a closer look at these levels and their associated costs:</p><h2>Standard Service</h2><p>The Standard Service is the most basic level offered by Beckett. It is ideal for collectors who are not in a rush to get their cards graded. The cost per card for the Standard Service is typically around $20 to $35, depending on the declared value of the card. This service usually takes around 30 business days for the grading process to be completed.</p><h2>Economy Service</h2><p>The Economy Service is a more affordable option for collectors looking for a budget-friendly grading solution. With this level of service, the cost per card is generally lower than the Standard Service. However, the turnaround time is longer, ranging from 60 to 90 business days. The specific cost for the Economy Service can vary, but it is typically around $15 to $30 per card.</p><h2>Express Service</h2><p>For collectors who wish to expedite the grading process, Beckett offers the Express Service. This level of service ensures a quicker turnaround time, usually within 20 business days. However, the cost per card is higher compared to the Standard and Economy Services. The pricing for the Express Service can range from $35 to $50 per card, depending on the declared value.</p><h2>Super Express Service</h2><p>If time is of the essence and you need your cards graded urgently, Beckett's Super Express Service is the way to go. This premium service guarantees an even faster turnaround time, typically within 10 business days. However, the cost per card is significantly higher compared to the other service levels. The price for the Super Express Service can range from $75 to $100 per card.</p><h2>Important Considerations</h2><p>When sending your cards to Beckett for grading, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:</p><li readability=0><p>Insurance: It is crucial to insure your cards when shipping them to Beckett.
