If yes you are familiar with the name<strong> Paul DelVecchio </strong>or <strong>Pauly D </strong>who starred as a housemate on all six seasons of the show from 2009, to 2012. Asides acting, he is popular as a disc jockey who started his career as a local DJ under the name Pauly D.</p><p><strong>Paul D. DelVecchio Jr.</strong> was born on July 5, 1980, in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. He is the son of<strong> Paul D. DelVecchio Sr.</strong> and <a href=#>Donna DiCarlo</a>. Paul has one sister <strong>Vanessa</strong>. So far, Paul holds American citizenship and is of mixed American Italian ethnicity. For his education, he attended Johnston High School.</p><h2>The Relationship Status Of DJ Paul</h2><p>Currently, the 39&nbsp;years old famous musician doesn't seem to be dating anyone. But he once had on an on-and-off&nbsp;relationship with singer <strong>Aubrey O'Day</strong>, 36, between 2015 and mid-2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/6/20/Aubrey-ODay-and-pauly-d-1592666574984.jpg><p>DelVecchio&nbsp;and O'Day first met each other on the set of reality TV show <i>Famously Single</i> in 2015. During their love period, they even starred together on <i>Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars</i>, which aired on We TV. On the show, the two reportedly spilt but never tied the knot.</p><p>But, in 2017, the former lovers ended their long-term relationship before their Marriage Boot Camp season premiered on TV in 2018. Since their split, they have kept making critical remarks about each other.</p><p>The 1.63 m tall singer-songwriter told <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>US Weekly</strong></a> in September 2018 that she "had really felt tortured" while she dates DJ. In contrast, Pauly D said her description made him feel shocked. “That’s such a strong word to say, like she’s a bit dramatic", he stated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/6/20/gettyimages-114584772-2048x2048-1592666642123.jpg><p>Prior to that, the disc jockey also had a love affair with his Jersey Shore's cast member <strong>Jenni JWoww Farley</strong>. The two started dating in 2009 but they parted their ways after just two months.</p><h2>He Is A Father Of One Daughter</h2><p>Indeed, the reality TV Star is the dad of one lovely daughter. He announced in October 2013 that he became a father for the first time to a little girl named <strong>Amabella Sophia Markert</strong>. &nbsp;“I’m proud I’m a father. I am excited to embark on this new part of my life,” Paul said at that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/6/20/Capture-1592668549710.JPG><p>His little baby girl Amabella was born in May 2013 to a woman <a href=#>Amanda Markert</a>, whom he had one night stand in Las Vegas Nevada. DJ and Amanda, who once worked as a waitress at Hooters, did not know each other before that night.</p><p>Then, Pauly D and Markert started a<strong> </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>custody battle</strong></a> over their child when Amabella was just 5 months old. Despite the ugly fighting, Markert later reportedly agreed to co-parent with Paul. Thus the pair puts aside their differences for their daughter's priority.</p><p>In 2014, they finally had worked out a temporary visiting rights agreement. The agreement will allow Pauly D to spend entire weekends with Amabella without the guidance of her mother, Amanda.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/6/20/Capture-1592668603551.JPG><p>Now, DJ's 7-year-old daughter now lives with her mother, Markert, in New Jersey. Before welcoming daughter Amabella, Markert already had a son named <strong>Mikey</strong>, from a past relationship.</p><h2>How Much is Pauly D Net Worth?</h2><p>Pauly D has maintained an impressive net worth of <strong>$20 Million</strong>.
