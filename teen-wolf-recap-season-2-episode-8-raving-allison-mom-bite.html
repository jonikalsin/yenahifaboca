Before being fired from the force, Stiles’ dad figured out that all of the Kanima’s victims were 24, which was the same age Isaac’s brother was when he died in the war. And when Stiles interrogated Jackson, he said all of his victims were murderers because “they killed me.” (Me who, you’re asking? Oh, how I wish I had the answer to that question.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>For Allison (<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Crystal Reed</a></strong>), it was an evening of mistakes — so many mistakes. For starters, she promised to go to the rave as Matt’s date; and just when we thought she was done being crazy, she told her dad that Jackson was the Kanima and that he’d be going after his next victim at the rave. Needless to say, most of the trouble that ensued probably could have been avoided had she just kept her yapper shut.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Taking advantage of the chaos, Allison’s mom kidnapped Scott (<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tyler Posey</a></strong>)&nbsp;and tried to kill him using wolf’s bane — and a vaporizer. (Apparently that‘s why she hangs around school all day, to see how kids smoke pot.) Unfortunately for Victoria (and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her Riddler hair</a>), Scott’s cries got Derek’s (<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tyler Hoechlin</a></strong>)&nbsp;attention, and he quickly came to Scott’s aid. He also took a nasty bite out of Victoria’s shoulder, which is where this bananas episode came to a close.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Other assorted thoughts:</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>>> What’s the deal with Ms. Morrell (<strong>Bianca Lawson</strong>)? We saw her chatting with the vet, and she seems to know “what’s coming,” but how does she factor into everything?</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>>> Coach (<strong>Orny Adams</strong>) looked especially cracked out this evening. He’s clearly upped his meth intake, but as long as he keeps being funny, I won’t narc him out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>>> This episode needed so much more Lydia. Seriously, where was she hiding?</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>How do you feel about tonight’s big twists? Do you think Allison’s dad will let her mom die, or crazier yet, let her become a wolf? Is Jackson somehow connected to the ghost of Isaac’s brother? Drop me a comment with your thoughts and theories!</p><h3>— Andy Swift</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10><a class=twitter-follow-button onclick='_gaq.push(["_trackEvent","outbound-article","http://twitter.com"])' href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @AndySwift</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>More Teen Wolf News:</strong></p><li>‘Teen Wolf’ Comic-Con Scoop: Who Gets Bitten Next, Plus More Spoilers</li><li>‘Teen Wolf’ Twist: Is Allison Turning Supernatural This Season?</li><li>A ‘Teen Wolf’ Couple Is ‘Strained,’ ‘The L.A.
