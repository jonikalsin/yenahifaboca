She became recognized after auditioning as a vocalist in the 9th season of the popular talent program ‘Britain’s Got Talent (BGT),’ just like her brother, who was a semi-finalist on the same show.</h3><h2>What is Jade Scott’s net worth?</h2><p>Jade Scott has a net worth of roughly <strong>$1 million</strong>, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><h2>Was Rejected By BGT:</h2><p>When her brother struck the golden buzzer and captured the hearts of the judges, Jade auditioned the same night. She began by singing ‘Say You Love Me,’ but judge Simon interrupted her and urged her to perform another song for them. She then sang ‘With or Without You,’ but that wasn’t enough to get the judges’ attention. The judges gave her four noes, and she was sent to him, which was quite disappointing.</p><h2>Jade Scott’s Brother Nearly Quit BGT:</h2><p>After Jade Scott was rejected by the BGT judges, her older brother Calum considered quitting the contest and came close to doing so. It’s because he was hurt and surprised that he received the golden buzzer while her sister couldn’t even earn a single ‘yes’. He was prepared to leave the program because of this, but Jade persuaded him to stay and win it for her. He didn’t win the show and finished sixth, but he gave it his all and made his sister proud.</p><h2>Does Jade Scott have child?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jade-Scott-with-her-son-Oliver.-1572855717130.jpg><p>Jade has already proven to be an excellent mother in her prior relationship. Oliver, her son, bears a striking resemblance to her. She, like his mother and uncle, Calum, is adorably adorable. She frequently shares photos and videos of her kid on social media, in which the mother-son duo can be seen having a lot of fun and spending quality time together. In addition, the child gets along well with his uncle. He is truly fortunate to have been born into such a loving and supportive family.</p><h2>Was Compared to Club Singer:</h2><p>Judge Simon Cowell described Jade Scott, 26, to a club singer after she performed two songs one after the other. Despite giving it her all in both songs, she wasn’t able to persuade the judges to press the button. Simon dismissed her as a club singer with a good voice and sent her home. Jade also didn’t seem to get into the songs she performed, according to judge Alesha Dixon.</p><h2>Brother is Openly Gay:</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jade-with-her-elder-brother-Calum-Scott.-1572855987740.jpg><p>The star of ‘Dancing On My Own,’ Jade’s brother, has declared that he is openly gay. He has stated that he is no longer afraid to be honest about his sexuality. He did admit, however, that he concealed his sexuality during the talent show. Calum, on the other hand, is not ashamed to admit that he is gay. He also wrote the song “No Matter What” after coming out as gay to the public.</p><h2>Active on Social Media Platforms:</h2><p>Jade Scott is active on popular social media platforms including Twitter and Instagram. On both sites, she goes by the handle @jadescottmusic, and she has 8,579 Instagram followers and 3,385 Twitter followers. You may definitely follow her because she publishes photographs and videos on a frequent basis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKKRmbJuv8Koq61n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cameron-philip.html><span>←</span><span>Cameron Philip - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</span></a>
