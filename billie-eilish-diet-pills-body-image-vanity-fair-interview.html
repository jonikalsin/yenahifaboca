The 19-year-old Billie has been open with her struggles <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>with self-harm</a> and a negative body image, and she shared just how bad things got when she was still a young girl. “To be quite honest with you, I only started wearing baggy clothes because of my body,” said the “Therefore I Am” singer. “I was really, really glad though, mainly, that I’m in this place in my life, because if that had happened three years ago, when I was in the midst of my horrible body relationship—or dancing a ton, five years ago, I wasn’t really eating.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I was, like, starving myself,” added Billie. “I remember taking a pill that told me that it would make me lose weight, and it only made me pee the bed—when I was 12. It’s just crazy. I can’t even believe, like I—wow. Yeah. I thought that I would be the only one dealing with my <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hatred for my body</a>, but I guess the internet also hates my body. So that’s great.” When Vanity Fair’s <strong>Keziah Weir </strong>suggests that the Internet hates “all women’s bodies,” Billie retorted with, “The internet hates women.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/billie-eilish-diet-pills-ap-images-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Billie’s comments seemingly referenced how the internet almost broke itself in October 2020, after Billie was photographed out and about<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> in a tank-top and sweat-shorts</a>. It was a rare sighting of Billie in something other than her signature baggy streetwear, and the response for the photos prompted Billie to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>share a TikTok</a> from influencer <strong>Chizi Duru, </strong>one that requested people “start normalizing real bodies, okay? “Not everybody has a wagon behind them, okay? Guts are normal. They’re normal. Boobs sag….especially after breastfeeding. Instagram isn’t real!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/billie-eilish-diet-pills-ap-images-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Months before Billie’s photographs went viral online, she spoke with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ magazine</a> about why she started wearing such oversized, figure-hiding outfits. “Here’s a bomb for you: I have never felt desired,” she told the publication. “My past boyfriends never made me feel desired. None of them. And it’s a big thing in my life that I feel I have never been physically desired by somebody.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I dress the way I dress as I don’t like to think of you guys — I mean anyone, everyone — judging it, or the size of it,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean that I won’t wake up one day and decide to wear a tank top, which I have done before.” Now that she has a much better “body relationship,” she will likely wear such outfits again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye5FuZpuhnKG2pnnEoqOiq5hisaqx02anoqScqHqju8OyZKKlkZyybsLAp6CtsV2brqq%2BjKKlrZ2iq7amw44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./50-cent-sire-spirits-washington-commanders-partnership.html><span>←</span><span>50 Cent's Sire Spirits Partners With Washington Commanders</span></a>
