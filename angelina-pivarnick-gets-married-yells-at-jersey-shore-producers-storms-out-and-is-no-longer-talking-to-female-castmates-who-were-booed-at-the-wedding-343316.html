As you can expect with any Jersey Shore event — this was no regular wedding.</p><p>All of her castmates were in attendance when Angelina said ‘I do’ to her fiance — even JWoww and Snooki who she had recently been feuding with. The ladies of the show served as her bridesmaids and the men were also in attendance.</p><p>Sources who attended the event say that everything was going off with a hitch until it came time for the speeches. Apparently, Jenni Farley, Nicole Polizzi, and Deena Cortese said somethings that didn’t resonate well with Angelina or the loved ones who were at the wedding.</p><p>An insider told US Weekly: ‘Deena, Snooki, and Jenni, in their speeches, made some jokes about Angelina. The audience at the wedding booed them. Their jokes were all in good fun, but they didn’t land and some didn’t think they were kind.’</p><p>The source revealed how Pivarnick reacted.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5G4MkHlGX5/</a></p><p>‘Angelina stormed off during the wedding and was upset about it. She was pissed. Now, she’s not talking to them.’</p><p>The entire thing was caught on camera.</p><p>Speaking of it being filmed, another eyewitness claimed that the Jersey Shore star screamed at the producers of the show.</p><p>This comes not long after the 33-year-old got into a fight with the best friends after JWoww’s ex-boyfriend inappropriately touched her during a night out.</p><p>Angelina confronted Snooki for being a ‘mean girl’ and taking Jenni’s side even though she wasn’t there when it happened.</p><p>It was believed that Farley and Polizzi would not be a part of the wedding considering that they don’t seem to be each other’s favorite people throughout the last few seasons of Jersey Shore Family Vacation.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Judging by the fallout of this wedding situation, maybe it should have stayed that way.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRo7SmuMinmGaomauus7rInKJmn5WpwG65wKupop2UYsamuMusZJqsXZ%2Bys7%2FEsmSsoJ%2Bnsm680aibrpuVp8Buv9OoqaarXaTCtXnAp5tmoaNiu7B5y6iloJ2iYsGiuMqipaBlpKR6p7HMmqOeZZOWwLW5wK2crGWnnbxuw8SrnGaan6SypXnArWStoJVixKaww6KloGVjaYB0fZVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-martina-mcbrides-daughter.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Martina McBrides daughter?
