Min-ho’s career started in 2003.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Lee Min-ho is, as of mid- 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Lee Min-ho’s net worth is as high as $10 million, an amount earned through his successful acting career. In addition to being a highly popular actor in South Korea, Min-ho has also worked as a model and musician which improved his net worth.</p><h3>Lee Min-ho Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Lee Min-ho wanted to become a professional footballer, but he suffered an injury while in elementary school, so his dreams were squashed. Instead, he started modelling and acting in the second year of high school. Lee had some minor roles from 2003 to 2007, when he landed his first leading role in a mini-series “Mackerel Run”, but it was cancelled after only eight episodes due to low ratings.</p><p>Also in 2007, Lee appeared in the series “I’m Sam”, and later in his first feature movie “Public Enemy 3” (2008) starring Kyung-gu Sol, Jae-yeong Jeong, and Jung-shik Bae, and in comedy “Our School’s E.T.” (2008). Lee gained a national-wide popularity with the role in series “Boys Over Flowers” in 2009, where he played Goo Joon Pyo, one of the four richest kids of the elite the elite Shin Hwa High Scool. This leading role significantly improved his net worth and also secured him roles in the future.</p><p>In 2010, Lee starred in “Personal Taste”, before landing a major part in series “City Hunter” (2011), playing Lee Yun-seong, a vengeful guy trained to kill everyone who stands in his way of personal vendetta. When the series finished, Lee had become a well-known actor and one of Korean cinematography’s biggest hopes. The next year, Lee filmed the series called “Faith”, a fantasy-drama that received good ratings and critiques. In 2013, Lee had a part in the series “Heirs”, a story of privileged, elite students who are trained to take over their families’ business; Lee played Kim Tan in 20 episodes.</p><p>After the success of “Heirs”, Lee switched to films, and most recently has appeared in the crime-drama “Gangnam Blues” (2015), and is currently shooting “Bounty Hunters” that is to be premiered by the end of 2016.</p><p>Besides being a regular in series and films, Lee has also recorded two albums: “My Everything” (2013) and “Song For You” (2014). Although he stated that doesn’t have plans to pursue a music career, Lee went on an Asian tour to meet his fans in cities such as Yokohama, Osaka, Shanghai, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Taipei, which probably added to his net worth. He is not only popular in South Korea, but also in big part of Asia, having won the online poll in 2014 and 2015 for the hottest Asian actor and being called “Asian Male God”. As of 2013, Lee even has his wax figure at the Madame Tussauds in Shanghai.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Lee Min-ho dated “City Hunter” co-worker Park Min-young, but their relationship didn’t last long. Lee is currently in a relationship with singer and actress Suzy. He survived a serious car accident in 2006 and was forced to spend months recovering in bed.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=16.616010854817><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Lee Min-ho</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 22, 1987</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Heukseok-dong, Gwangju, South Korea</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.87 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Editorial Department</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Konkuk University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>South Korean</td></tr><tr readability=0.3265306122449><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/OfficialLeeMinho</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/actorleeminho</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3316279/</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>SBS Drama Awards for Best Couple, more</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Albums</td><td>My Everything, Song For You</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>PaekSang Arts Award for Most Popular Male in Television, more</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>Bounty Hunters, Gangnam Blues, Our School's E.T., Public Enemy Returns, Get Up</td></tr><tr readability=14><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Heirs, Faith, City Hunter, Personal Taste, Boys Over Flowers, I Am Sam, Mackerel Run, Sharp, Secret Campus, Romance, The Legend of the Blue Sea, Recipe of Love</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=3.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>As a young child, Lee Min-Ho hoped to become a football (soccer) player, but an injury in the 5th grade of elementary school ended those dreams.
