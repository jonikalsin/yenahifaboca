tagged Khloe.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also posted pictures of Khloe wearing a sheer black bedazzled leotard, beside a picture of a very similar catsuit from her own line.</p><p

Ms. Bleu did not create the concept or design of a bodysuit with crystals – a fashion style that has been around for decades as evidenced by the fact that Cher has been wearing these styles for over 25 years. The Good American design team designed a range of eleven bodysuits and had never heard of Ms. Bleu or seen her designs.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-3a6cfabea117389f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/10/02/44041377-9670805-Birthday_tribute_Meanwhile_on_Khloe_s_own_Instagram_the_star_pen-a-40_1623290145404.jpg height=673 width=634 alt="Birthday tribute:&nbsp;Meanwhile on Khloe's own Instagram, the star penned a sweet birthday tribute to her close pal Savas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-3a6cfabea117389f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/10/02/44041377-9670805-Birthday_tribute_Meanwhile_on_Khloe_s_own_Instagram_the_star_pen-a-40_1623290145404.jpg height=673 width=634 alt="Birthday tribute:&nbsp;Meanwhile on Khloe's own Instagram, the star penned a sweet birthday tribute to her close pal Savas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=imageCaption>Birthday tribute:&nbsp;Meanwhile on Khloe’s own Instagram, the star penned a sweet birthday tribute to her close pal Savas</p><img decoding=async id=i-7e98affa58d9a05f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/10/02/44041383-9670805-Best_day_Happy_birthday_worldwidesavas_I_hope_you_have_the_best_-a-41_1623290145405.jpg height=415 width=634 alt="Best day!
