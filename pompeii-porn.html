If you were walking through the city of Pompeii around 100 B.C., you’d see a wide amphitheater, ornately-constructed bathhouses, column-lined temples…and penises. Lots of penises. Around 80 percent of the artwork decorating this ancient Roman town would be considered explicit today, according to Rev. Canon Steve Chalke, a prominent British evangelical Christian."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Which, thanks to Pompeii and Chalke, we now do.</p><p>“500 years ago, Martin Luther and Calvin didn’t have the tools that we now have to assist us in our contextual understanding of the writings of scriptures. We’ve come miles because of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, miles because of archaeological discoveries around Pompeii, and we’ve had all sorts of other cultural and linguistic leaps forward,” Chalke told <a href=#>the Huffington Post</a>. “It’s our job to use them and I think, in using them, we find these old understandings really don’t work anymore.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-123088 alt="Pompeii Threesome" width=514 height=422 data-sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pompeii-threesome.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-123088 class=wp-caption-text>A Pompeii threesome.</p><p>Typically, church leaders avoid talking about porn — much less flashing images of it on a screen behind their shoulder.</p><p>But that’s what Chalke did in a video lecture for the Oasis Open Church Network, which he made to teach people about how wild things were in Roman times.</p><p></p><p><a href=#>Understanding the New Testament and Sexuality</a> from <a href=#>Open Church network</a> on <a href=#>Vimeo</a>.</p><p>Sex, he insists, was everywhere — it was considered natural, and spiritual and totally appropriate between all genders.</p><p>But it could also be exploitative. Rules at the time dictated that Roman men could only have affairs with people of “lesser status” — in other words, people who were not considered to be Roman citizens.</p><p>“Roman boys were protected in a way that slave boys weren’t. For a Roman man, sex was a legitimate part of life, but you had to have sex with an inferior and you had to penetrate them, you weren’t allowed to be penetrated,” Chalke said.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-123093 alt="Pompeii Male Lovers" width=600 height=900 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pompeii-male-lovers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-123093 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>A&G Reporter/AGF/UIG via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Men in a Pompeii fresco.</span></p><p>Because of this cultural (note: not religious) restriction on same-sex relations — in which wealthy or high-status people were seeking out more vulnerable groups of men — same-sex intercourse was seen as the result of a power imbalance.</p><p>It’s this exploitation — not the physical, same-sex relation — Chalke says, that Paul and other Biblical authors, condemned.</p><p>They never said anything about mutual, genuine love between people of the same gender.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-123087 alt="Pompeii Oral" width=513 height=480 data-sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pompeii-oral.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-123087 class=wp-caption-text>Pompeii wall art.</p><p>“The people Paul is talking about, he said they’ve abandoned God, they’re full of deceit, lying,” Chalke told the Post. “Whoever Paul is talking about, it cannot be the wonderful same-sex couples that are in our church, or the gay man or the transgender woman I know. It just can’t be them.”</p><p>So, Jesus-lovers, feel free to kick back, flip through some ancient threesome porn, and come to terms with the idea that Pompeii gay sex was bad — because it was seen as a powerful man taking advantage of a marginalized individual — but modern consensual gay sex is totally cool.</p><p>Because this religious leader said you can.</p><p>“Our poor understanding of the New Testament has brought misery, persecution, oppression and rejection to countless hundreds of thousands and millions of LGBT people,” Chalke said. “It’s time to apologize for the mistakes we’ve made and move on.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-123089 alt="Pompeii Penis" width=600 height=813 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pompeii-penis.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-123089 class=wp-caption-text>Look!
