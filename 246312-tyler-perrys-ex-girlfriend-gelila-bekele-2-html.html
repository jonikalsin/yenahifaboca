While she looked gorgeous, the highlight of the post was her caption.</p><p class=dh>In it, she wrote that the whole world experienced so much fear, loss, and pain. Bekele also opened up of her own challenges, including losing her grandmother, her “heart & soul.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/cef91a346f575de5653b67dd7a998c70.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Gelila Bekele on December 16, 2013 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>IT’S ALL ABOUT FAITH</strong></p><p class=dh>After labeling it as her most painful “endurance,” the writer pointed out that faith pulls people through hardships and that the human spirit survives, loves, and heals. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CJei1ScJhKd/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>“‘Put into the world what without you may never exist.’ I hold on to this quote moving forward. Happy - Healthy New Year to us.”</p><p class=dh>Bekele, who began her career as a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.gelilabekele.com/about/>model in 2006</a> and is currently represented by Elite Model Management in the States, made headlines in mid-December after her and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/tyler-perry-says-he-s-single-experiencing-midlife-crisis-t204209>Tyler Perry’s split</a> was confirmed.</p><p class=dh>It was the “House of Payne” creator and producer who actually revealed their separation on social media by posting a photo in front of a mirror and writing that he was 51 and single in the caption.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>[Perry] once said he was not sure about marriage because of his work ethic.</strong></h3><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SINGLE AND READY</strong></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/p/CI4QTboH7_Z/>According to Perry,</a> he’s wondering what the next chapter in his life will look like. No matter what, he plans on walking with God, be the best father and man possible, and “try to look my best doing it.”</p><p class=dh>Perry and Bekele’s relationship was kept under wraps. They <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/tyler-perry-and-gelila-bekele-split/>met at a Prince concert</a> back in 2007, and while they “amicably split” some time ago, they are focused on co-parenting their son, Aman.</p><p class=dh>The boy, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/who-is-gelila-bekele-activist-filmmaker-tyler-perry-4285638/>born in 2014</a>, definitely brought joy to their lives. Perry once admitted that there was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/tyler-perry-and-gelila-bekele-split/>nobody else</a> on the planet he would’ve wanted to have a child with apart from Bekele.</p><p class=dh>While Perry and Bekele were together for years, they never tied the knot. Perry’s fans probably remember that he once said he was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tyler-perry-marriage-father-video_n_3331989>not sure about marriage</a> because of his work ethic.</p><p class=dh>As per being a dad, he admitted he’d be a “great father,” and that’s what he is to Aman. He avoids sharing photos of him online, though, just like he barely uploaded photos of <a class="me a" href=#>Bekele</a> while they were dating.</p><p class=dh>At the moment, Perry has his hands full, especially because <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/tyler-perry-and-gelila-bekele-split/>he was announced</a> as the producer of “Sister Act 3.” It is important to point out that the original film was released almost three decades ago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrb2thZ3q1xcueqWaolae%2Fur%2BMnq9mn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWWXmrmquMBmmZ6jlaGybn6NoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-louis-the-definitive-retrospective-on-the-indomitable-champions-illustrious-boxing-career.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Louis: The Definitive Retrospective on the Indomitable Champion's Illustrious Boxing Career</span></a>
