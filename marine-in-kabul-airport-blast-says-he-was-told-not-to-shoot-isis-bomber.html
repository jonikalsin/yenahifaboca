Tyler&nbsp;Vargas-Andrews recounted to the <a href=#>House Foreign Affairs Committee </a>how his team deployed to <a href=#>Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 26, 2021</a>, and were tracking a man who intelligence officers believed was a suicide bomber “throughout the entirety” of the day leading up to the explosion.</p><p>“Intel guys confirmed the suicide bomber … described as clean-shaven, brown-dressed, black vest and traveling with an older companion,” he said. “I asked intel guys why he wasn’t apprehended sooner since we had a full description. I was told the asset could not be compromised.”</p><p>Vargas-Andrews recounted his experience during his opening remarks at the committee’s hearing examining the Biden administration’s handling of the final weeks of the <a href=#>20-year US war in Afghanistan</a>. The chaotic effort brought massive crowds to the airport with fewer than 6,000 US troops deployed to assist.</p><p>Vargas-Andrews told the committee that his team continually updated intelligence teams that day on the suspect’s actions, noting the men were an “anomaly in the crowd” and “both had obvious mannerisms that go along with who we believed him to be.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">On Wednesday, Sgt.

But the Marines were told not to shoot because “leadership did not have the engagement authority for us.”</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>5</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p class="ad__label ad__label--top">Advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/NYPICHPDPICT000007886074.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/NYPICHPDPICT000007886358.jpg><p><span class=screen-reader-text>Advertisement</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/NYPICHPDPICT000007886084.jpg><p><span class=screen-reader-text>Advertisement</span></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Scores were injured and killed in the bombing. <span class=credit>via REUTERS</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Vargas-Andrews said he requested permission to kill the suspected terrorist and his team leader got a sniper gun ready. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Unwilling to give up, the Marine then asked his battalion commander, Lt. Col. Brad Whited, “to come to the tower to see what we did.” While Vargas-Andrews waited for the commander to appear, “psychological operations individuals came to our tower immediately and confirmed the suspect met the suicide bomber description.”</p><p>When Whited finally arrived, Vargas-Andrews said, his team showed him evidence and photos of the men.</p><p>“Pointedly … we asked him if we could shoot,” he said. “Our battalion commander said, and I quote: ‘I don’t know.'”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Vargas-Andrews was working in the crowd outside the airport’s Abbey Gate when an ISIS terrorist detonated the suicide vest. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The Marine believes that the man was the suicide bomber responsible for killing 13 Americans and more than 160 Afghans later that day. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Vargas-Andrews at the airport eight days before the suicide bombing. <span class=credit>Sgt.

Because this is your responsibility, Sir.'”</p><p>“He again replied he did not know who and would find out. We received no update and never got our answer,” he said. “Eventually the individual disappeared. To this day we believe he was a suicide bomber.”</p><p>Hours later, Vargas-Andrews was working in the crowd outside the airport’s Abbey Gate when an ISIS terrorist detonated a suicide vest, killing 13 Americans and more than 160 Afghans.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Vargas-Andrews criticized the withdrawal of the US forces and said the deaths of his fellow service members have been left unanswered. <span class=credit>via REUTERS</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The bombing killed 13 US service members. <span class=credit>VIA REUTERS</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Vargas-Andrews blasted the withdrawal as a “catastrophe.” <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Vargas-Andrews, who lost an arm and a leg in the blast, was one of the roughly 45 troops who were injured but survived.</p><p>“We were ignored. Our expertise was disregarded,” he said of the lead-up to the blast. “No one was held accountable for our safety.”</p><p>Nearly 130,000 people were airlifted from <a href=#>Afghanistan during the mission, but the Biden administration has been regularly criticized</a> for ending the mission before hundreds of Americans and thousands of former elite Afghan military personnel, interpreters and women leaders promised sanctuary could be evacuated.</p><p>Ending his opening statement, Vargas-Andrews requested that the House committee ask him more about the day of the bombing, noting that “no one wanted my report post-blasts — even NCIS and the FBI failed to interview me.”</p><p>“The withdrawal was a catastrophe, in my opinion, and there was an inexcusable lack of accountability and negligence,” he said. “The 11 Marines, one sailor and one soldier that were murdered that day have not been answered for.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmaXBfoq6ztc2eZKKmXaCuo8HLZpiiqqCkv7V5waWYrKxdqK66v4yhnGavkah6tbvLnWSnp6RiwbB50qGmqKxdnsCqv4ybpqaalad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-edwards.html><span>←</span><span>Jordan Edwards</span></a>
